# portfolio-generator

This application uses javascript, node.js, html, and CSS in order to generate a github portfolio for other developers! 

# Important Side-note!

  If anyone ever wants to look at the application, they'll have to clone it to their own local machine and run it from there! This is machine based code, so this is why that is!
